CITATION

print: do smooths and ranefs separately

2D: reparameterizeDesign: decompose into marginal smooths and interaction surface,  
	example in vignette,
	getF/plotF, 

coef method

varying coefficient models: ensure identifiability for f1(x1)*u + f2(x2)*u

Done(?): expandBasis: replace for-loops (and list str) with sth moore efficient, takes forever if by has many levels

make compatible to allcoef-branch

change formula evaluation etc to sth like used in mboost/lm (ask Manuel?)

add general GMRF-constructor (based on graph/adjacency matrix?)
